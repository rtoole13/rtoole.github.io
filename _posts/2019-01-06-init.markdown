#### The blog
I'm not sure how often I'll end up posting here, but my hope is that having a dedicated blog showcased so prominently will compel me to write more, eventually forming a habit.

Here I'll comment on games I'm playing, maybe praise a developer now and again, share general thoughts on the industry, and discuss my own experiences with game development. I've accumulated a number of ramblings on the topic, most of which were cranked out in the mushed brain state following a long programming session. So we'll see what can be salvaged there. 

Most posts will surely concern my unceasing rediscovery of how hard, yet inevitably gratifying, game dev can be. If I can encourage just a single new or struggling dev to stick with it, I'll be happy!

Wise words. No, really I'm just fairly new to web dev and wanted to check out the block quote styling. Neat.

#### The site
Now a bit about the site. Considering a number of my projects call GitHub home, GitHub Pages seemed an ideal location for my personal site. While I intended to develop a theme with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> from scratch, I quickly realized the project would consume more of my time than desired. Thus, for now, I'll be making use of the <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/folio/" target="_blank">*folio</a> theme, built by Lia Bogoev.

That's all for now!
