Feeling inspired by one of my all time favorites, *Team Fortress 2*, I decided to start prototyping a grenade jumpin' side-scroller. Some greyboxing of the basic movement mechanics are shown below. 
<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

Alongside the grenade jumping, I threw in a slide mechanic akin to that of *Apex Legends*, where the character slides indefinitely on slopes and slows to a halt after a time on horizontals. There are some negative gravity wells in there too. Oh, and inclines of a certain slope aren't climbable..
<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

Working on some placeholder art and the motivation to complete it at the moment!
